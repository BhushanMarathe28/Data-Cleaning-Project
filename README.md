## EXCEL-DATA-CLEANING-PROJECT
This project demonstrates advanced data cleaning techniques in Microsoft Excel using powerful formulas and functions. It focuses on transforming raw, messy datasets into clean, structured, and analysis-ready data.

## Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to clean, standardize, and prepare raw data using Microsoft Excel, applying advanced formulas and functions to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis. This project aims to:
- Demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning using Excel
- Improve data quality by identifying and correcting errors
- Structure unorganized data for efficient analysis and reporting
- Showcase advanced Excel techniques commonly used in real-world data preparation tasks

## Key Features:
- Removal of duplicates and unnecessary spaces
- Standardization of names, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates
- Salary and numeric data formatting
- Splitting and combining text fields
- Handling missing or invalid data
- Use of advanced Excel formulas such as TEXT, SUBSTITUTE, TRIM, IF, ISERROR, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, and more

## Process
The project followed a systematic step-by-step data cleaning process using Microsoft Excel
- Data Import - Loaded raw data from various sources into Excel for cleaning and inspection
- Initial Assessment - Reviewed the dataset for missing values, inconsistent formats, and structural issues
- Text Cleaning - Removed extra spaces, corrected capitalization, and standardized naming conventions
- Validation & Correction - Fixed invalid email formats, standardized phone numbers, and corrected city names
